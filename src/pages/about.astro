                I'm a lifelong technologist, having taken my first steps into the world of computing somewhere in the
                early 90's.
                <br/><br/>
                How'd it all start? Damn, that's a tough one. ü§î
                <br/><br/>
                My journey began back before the Internet had become a thing in Australia. I was extremely fortunate ‚Äî
                growing up in a household with a computer, I was exposed to the world of technology at a very young age.
                My father, whilst not necessarily a computer enthusiast, was rather familiar with them ‚Äî jockeying the
                operating system to do his bidding, using all the commonplace methods of the time, that'd likely seem
                like utter madness to the younger cohorts of today's computer users.
                <br/><br/>
                It was madness though...
                <br/><br/>
                It was a DOS world, and Windows 3.1 was the new kid on the block. Software was built by wizards, and
                games were played in 16 colors. Want to play some SkiFree? Sure, better get to digging up that floppy.
                Things not quite going to plan? The three-finger salute (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> +
                <kbd>Del</kbd>) was a reflexive action for many.
                <br/><br/>
                It's hard to fathom what we put up with back then, but it was all we knew. It was a time of discovery,
                of learning, and of growth ‚Äî reminiscing, through the rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia, it's hard not to
                feel a sense of longing for those times. Or perhaps, just the feelings that those fledgling experiences
                with computers evoked.
                <br/><br/>
                But I digress... My dad was the guy that set the wheels in motion. It wasn't intentional, but it
                happened all the same. I was a curious kid, and the IBM machine that sat in the entryway of our family
                home was a beacon of intrigue. I distinctly recall the hardcore "thunk" of the power switch, as the
                machine roared to life. The screen flickered as the boot sequence progressed, from the BIOS all the way
                through to the familiar <code>C:\></code> prompt. It was a world of possibilities, and I was hooked.
                <br/><br/>
                It wasn't long before I discovered
                <a class="underline-hover"
                   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC"
                   target="_blank">BASIC</a>,
                and with that, I commenced my ascent (descent?) into the world of programming.
                <br/><br/>
                Years passed, and my interest in technology only grew. I, like many, was introduced to video games sunk
                countless hours into them. A distraction from more productive pursuits perhaps, but the games
                themselves would only serve as kindling for a fire that would continue to burn off into my adult life.
                <br/><br/>
                Prior to finishing primary school, I'd gotten in the habit of repurposing old discarded computers
                (typically i486s,
                <Icon name="mdi:desktop-classic"
                      width={25}

                      class="icon-inline"/>
                Pentium IIs, etc.) and setting up all kinds of networks between them. Sometimes, I'd
                utilise a null-model to 1v1 with my brother over a serial connection, and at other times, I'd source a
                hub and some cheap NICs so that I could host a 4-player game of CNC Red Alert. Those times were just the
                best!
                <br/><br/>
                By the time I hit high school, I was pretty clued up on most things computer-related. I continued
                building my own machines, obsessing over games, and learning how to code. I'd dabbled in a few languages
                by this point, but it wasn't until I discovered C++ that I truly felt everything click into place.
                <br/><br/>
                Like all intrepid young programmers, I set out to build a game.
